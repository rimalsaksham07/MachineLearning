    "### 1.Feature Transformation - \n",
    "You have a feature (columns) and you transform that column to better column then it is feature transformation.It is the first step \n",
    "for example - Missing values , Handling Categorical , Outlier , Feature Scaling \n",
    "##### 1.Missing Values \n",
    "Handling missing values some library dont accept missing value either we can remove or fill the mssing value \n",
    "##### 2.Handling Cateogrical Values\n",
    "Convert into numerical values because our library dont accept categorical value (one hot encoding) for eg age is numerical value but range of age is categorical value\n",
    "##### 3.Outlier Detection \n",
    "Faulty values haru data bhanda nachaiyeko value haru which should be deducted so outlier detection should be done\n",
    "##### 4.Feature Scaling\n",
    "Input column or feature can have different scale for eg age = 20 and salary = 200000 so there is distinct values in age and salary. Difference of salary and age is very large so we have to scale the features before giving data (log transform)\n",
    "### 2.Feature Construction - \n",
    "(Manually creating a Feature) we create completely new column with domain knowledge for example you have two columns of no of siblings and no of parentchild data then you can create a new column for family by using those two data so here we add two columns and made it to one this is feature construction.\n",
    "### 3.Feature Selection - \n",
    "(Selecting only some feature which are needed) in the given features we extract only those features which are very important and other are ignored to make algorithm better\n",
    "### 4.Feature Extraction \n",
    "(given feature we extract a completely new feature programatically) \n",
    "rooms | washroom | price ---------- given data \n",
    "so now if it want to use a most imporatant features which to use? \n",
    "we can combine rooms and washroom and give it a new column for square feet and calculate the price so we create completely new feature this process is feature extraction where we do this process programmatically"
